Its unique character\n        derives from wonderful sacral architecture. In 300m, close to each other\n        there are: Orthodox church of Nativity of Theotokos, church of St.\n        Anthony of Padua - a Roman Catholic temple, Synagogue pod Białym\n        Bocianem and an Evangelical church of Divine Providence.

The District is\n        considered a historical monument. On 29 November 2012 on the corner of\n        the streets Kazimierza Wielkiego and Św. Antoniego the Cristal Planet\n        statue was exhibited. The sculpture created by Ewa Rossano, an artist\n        from Wrocław, became another symbol of the District.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The Four Denominations District hosts many cultural and educational\n        events. The Synagogue is a place of special meaning. It hosts many\n        artistic events, every summer there are concerts and exhibitions\n        organised under the name “Summer in The White Stroke Synagogue”. A\n        similar function has the nearby cinema Nowe Horyzonty. It is the first\n        cinema in Poland devoted to artistic films and hosts the most important\n        film festivals in Wrocław.
