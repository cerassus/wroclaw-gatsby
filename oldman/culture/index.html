Today there are 100 bridges and 33 gangways. Unique on a Polish and European scale, the number of crossings is due to the location of the city. Wrocław is crossed by the rivers of Oder, Ślęza, Widawa, Bystrzyca, Dobra and a dozen or so streams. Depending on the water level there are up to 25 islands in the city boundaries.</p></div><div class="sc-ezzayL dvEEhY"><img src="img/culture/oldtown_icon.png" alt="icon img" class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"/><h3 class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn">monuments</h3><p class="sc-iklIKw cEFmYS">Wrocław has two objects on the list of Monuments of History - the most valuable distinction awarded in the country to objects considered particularly valuable for culture, under the patronage of the President of the Republic of Poland. They are: the Historic Center Complex and Centennial Hall. The city has many viewpoints located on monuments, for example the northern tower of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist.</p></div><div class="sc-ezzayL dvEEhY"><img src="img/culture/dwarf_icon.png" alt="icon img" class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"/><h3 class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn">dwarfs</h3><p class="sc-iklIKw cEFmYS">Wrocław’s dwarfs are small figurines that first appeared in the city streets in 2005. Since then, their numbers have been continually growing, and today they are considered a tourist attraction: those who would like to combine sight-seeing in Wrocław with &quot;Hunting for dwarfs&quot; are offered special brochures with a map and mobile application. As of 2015, there are over 350 dwarfs spread all over the city.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="sc-bdnylx dBIAOO"><div width="120" class="sc-gtssRu kFtpsa"><div class="sc-jJMGHv crVslF"><div width="50%" height="100%" src="img/culture/oldtown.jpg" class="sc-hKFyIo gVxLao"></div><div class="sc-hiKfjK eTyHFg"><h2 class="sc-dlnjPT ersfVI">Old Town</h2><p>Ostrów Tumski is the oldest part of the city of Wrocław. It was formerly an island known as the Cathedral Island between the branches of the Oder River, featuring the Wrocław Cathedral, built originally in the mid 10th century. The 13th century Main Market Square features the Old Town Hall. In the north-west corner of the Market Square is St. Elisabeth&#x27;s Church with its 91.46 m tower, which has an observation deck. North of the church are the Shambles with Monument of Remembrance of Animals for Slaughter. Salt Square is located at the south-western corner of the Market Square. Close to the square, between Szewska and Łaciarska streets, is the 13th century St. Mary Magdalene Church.</p></div></div><div class="sc-jJMGHv crVslF"><div width="50%" height="100%" src="img/culture/museum.png" class="sc-hKFyIo kkkJMH"></div><div class="sc-hiKfjK eTyHFg"><h2 class="sc-dlnjPT ersfVI">National Museum</h2><p>The National Museum in Wrocław, established 28 March 1947, is one of Poland&#x27;s main branches of the National Museum system. It holds one of the largest collections of contemporary art in the country. The holdings of Wrocław Museum are closely connected with the history of border shifts in Central Europe following World War II. After the annexation of Eastern half of the Second Polish Republic by the Soviet Union, main parts of Poland&#x27;s art collections were transferred from the cities incorporated into the USSR. Collections not returned included the Ossolineum holdings which became part of the Lviv National Museum.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="sc-bdnylx yyesE"><div width="40%" src="img/culture/pedestrian.jpg" class="sc-hKFyIo clViX"></div><div class="sc-gtssRu lihdfc"><h2 class="sc-dlnjPT ersfVI">The Anonymous Pedestrian</h2><p>The sculpture presents people who go down, under the pavement and emerge from it.

Its original was the installation of Kalina from 1977 “Passage” (that is why the sculpture is also known by this name). The Sculpture of Anonymous Pedestrian (Pomnik Anonimowego Przechodnia) was showed for the first time in 2005, the author did not change the project, the people wear the clothes from the 70s.</p><p>The Sculpture of Anonymous Pedestrian is often mentioned globally. In 2011 it was mentioned by Newsweek as one of the most beautiful places in Poland and an American Budget Travel recognised it as one of the most remarkable places in the world. In Autumn 2014 it was presented as one of the most creative city sculptures by www.boredpanda.com. In Spring 2015 a prestigious design and architecture magazine Arch2O included it in its ranking - it was the only object from Poland.</p></div></section><section class="sc-bdnylx dBIAOO"><div class="sc-eCApGN sc-ciSmjq htLRdL eGqnrC"><div class="sc-gtssRu cLCxTN"><h2 class="sc-dlnjPT ersfVI">City Stadium</h2><p>Chinese lantern - that is how people think of the Wrocław Stadium.
