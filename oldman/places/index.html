It consists of the area between the streets Kazimierza Wielkiego, Św. Mikołaja, Pawła Włodkowica and Św. Antoniego.</p><p>It is not a regular, urban district but the unique atmosphere of the place caused that since 1995 it has been called Four Temples District, Four Denominations or Mutual Respect District. Its unique character derives from wonderful sacral architecture. In 300m, close to each other there are: Orthodox church of Nativity of Theotokos, church of St. Anthony of Padua - a Roman Catholic temple, Synagogue pod Białym Bocianem and an Evangelical church of Divine Providence. In 1996 the Council of the Mutual Respect District was created in order to encourage cooperation between the religions.</p><p>In 2005 the temples were connected with a “cultural route” and the area between them was included in the urban development plan. The District is considered a historical monument. On 29 November 2012 on the corner of the streets Kazimierza Wielkiego and Św. Antoniego the Cristal Planet statue was exhibited. The sculpture created by Ewa Rossano, an artist from Wrocław, became another symbol of the District.</p><p>The Four Denominations District hosts many cultural and educational events. The Synagogue is a place of special meaning. It hosts many artistic events, every summer there are concerts and exhibitions organised under the name “Summer in The White Stroke Synagogue”.
