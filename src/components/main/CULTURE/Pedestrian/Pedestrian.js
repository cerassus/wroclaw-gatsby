        The sculpture presents people who go down, under the pavement and emerge
        from it. Its original was the installation of Kalina from 1977 “Passage”
        (that is why the sculpture is also known by this name). The Sculpture of
        Anonymous Pedestrian (Pomnik Anonimowego Przechodnia) was showed for the
        first time in 2005, the author did not change the project, the people
        wear the clothes from the 70s.

        The Sculpture of Anonymous Pedestrian is often mentioned globally. In
        2011 it was mentioned by Newsweek as one of the most beautiful places in
        Poland and an American Budget Travel recognised it as one of the most
        remarkable places in the world. In Autumn 2014 it was presented as one
        of the most creative city sculptures by www.boredpanda.com. In Spring
        2015 a prestigious design and architecture magazine Arch2O included it
        in its ranking - it was the only object from Poland.
