          The beginnings of Wrocław are connected with a settlement that
          developed at a spot convenient for crossing the Oder River, at a
          crossroads of important and old communication trails coming from
          Southern Europe to the North, to the Baltic Sea and from the West to
          the East, to the region of the Black Sea.

          In the first half of 10th century, the territory of Silesia came under
          the reign of Bohemia, and the settlement, at that time surely having
          the nature of a frontier city, most probably obtained the name after
          Bohemian Prince Vratislaus.{" "}

          In the last decade of the 10th century, Silesia was included within
          the Polish borders. In 1000, during the reign of Bolesław I “the
          Valiant” (Bolesław Chrobry), a papal edict came out – the oldest
          preserved, written mention about Wrocław, which set the city as the
          seat of the Wrocław bishopric, subordinate to the Archbishopric of
          Gniezno.{" "}

          During the period of fragmentation in Poland, Silesia and the largest
          of its cities became the domain of a new line of princes – the
          Silesian Piasts. Numerous settlements arouse around the ducal city
          located on the Oder islands. At the beginning of 13th century, they
          started gradually transforming into one city organism. This process
          sped up after the Mongol invasion of 1241, during which Wrocław itself
          was also partially demolished. The city was rebuilt based on German
          law. At this time, the German colonists that took over a domineering
          role among the citizens were encouraged by the Silesian Piasts to
          settle in Silesia, who hoped that it would support the process of
          rending their lands habitable. In the second half of the 13th century,
          the city already had brick city walls and a moat. In 1261, in
          compliance with the Magdeburg Law given to Wrocław, a government body
          took over managing the city – the City Council.
