          Surrounded by the river Oder, the old burgh, the origin of the city,
          has fantastic architecture. The greatest ones are the Gothic St. John

          There is the Archdiocese Museum there, the oldest historically
          continuous museum in Wrocław - for over 100 years it has gathered
          sacral art, which was excluded from cult use and has great historical
          and artistic value. Among the exhibits one can find Henrykowska Book
          from 13th-14th century, which contains the first sentence written in
          Polish.{" "}

          The cathedral was very badly damaged (about 70% of the building)
          during the Siege of Breslau and heavy bombing by the Red Army in the
          last days of World War II. Not only because of Soviet aerial and
          artillery bombardment, but also as a result of the self-destructive
          actions of the SS and the NSDAP, 80 to 90 per cent of Breslau was
          destroyed . . . after the Soviet capture of the Gandauer airfield, the
          Wehrmacht destroyed many houses and three churches to build a
          provisional airstrip 200 to 400 meters wide and two kilometers long.
          — August 1945 report of damage to Breslau by employees of the Saxony
          state administration[20] Parts of the interior fittings were saved and
          are now on display at the National Museum in Warsaw. The initial
          reconstruction of the church lasted until 1951, when it was
          reconsecrated by Archbishop Stefan Wyszyński. In the following years,
          additional aspects were rebuilt and renovated. The original, conical
          shape of the towers was restored only in 1991.

          The current cathedral is a three-nave Gothic oriented basilica
          surrounded by an ambulatory. The cathedral has three entrances: the
          main western portal and two later entrances from the north and south.
