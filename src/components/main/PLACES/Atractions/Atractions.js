            The Racławice Panorama is a monumental (15 × 114 meter) cycloramic
            painting depicting the Battle of Racławice, during the Kościuszko
            Uprising. The painting is one of only a few preserved relics of a
            genre of 19th-century mass culture, and the oldest in Poland. The
            panorama stands in a circular fashion and, with the viewer in the
            center, presents different scenes at various viewing angles. A
            special kind of perspective used in the painting and additional
            effects (lighting, artificial terrain) create a feeling of reality.

            The Centennial Hall, formerly named "People's Hall", is a historic
            building near the city center. It was constructed according to the
            plans of architect Max Berg in 1911–1913, when the city was part of
            the German Empire. Max Berg designed Centennial Hall to serve as a
            multifunctional structure to host "exhibitions, concerts, theatrical
            and opera performances, and sporting events." The hall continues to
            be used for sporting events and concerts. As an early landmark of
            reinforced concrete architecture, the building became one of
            Poland's official national Historic Monuments, as designated April
            20, 2005, together with the Four Domes Pavilion, the Pergola, and
            the Iglica. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board
            of Poland. It was also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in
            2006.
