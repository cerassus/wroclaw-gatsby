      <Common.TextTitle>Four Denominations District</Common.TextTitle>
      <p>
        The Four Denominations District – a place of meetings, dialogue, mutual
        respect and... numerous culinary experiences.

      <p>
        The Four Denominations District (Dzielnica Czterech Świątyń) is located
        in the centre of Wrocław, right next to Rynek. It consists of the area
        between the streets Kazimierza Wielkiego, Św. Mikołaja, Pawła Włodkowica
        and Św. Antoniego.

        It is not a regular, urban district but the unique atmosphere of the
        place caused that since 1995 it has been called Four Temples District,
        Four Denominations or Mutual Respect District. Its unique character
        derives from wonderful sacral architecture. In 300m, close to each other
        there are: Orthodox church of Nativity of Theotokos, church of St.
        Anthony of Padua - a Roman Catholic temple, Synagogue pod Białym
        Bocianem and an Evangelical church of Divine Providence. In 1996 the
        Council of the Mutual Respect District was created in order to encourage
        cooperation between the religions.

        In 2005 the temples were connected with a “cultural route” and the area
        between them was included in the urban development plan. The District is
        considered a historical monument. On 29 November 2012 on the corner of
        the streets Kazimierza Wielkiego and Św. Antoniego the Cristal Planet
        statue was exhibited. The sculpture created by Ewa Rossano, an artist
        from Wrocław, became another symbol of the District.

        The Four Denominations District hosts many cultural and educational
        events. The Synagogue is a place of special meaning. It hosts many
        artistic events, every summer there are concerts and exhibitions
        organised under the name “Summer in The White Stroke Synagogue”. A
        similar function has the nearby cinema Nowe Horyzonty. It is the first
        cinema in Poland devoted to artistic films and hosts the most important
        film festivals in Wrocław. New Horizon Festival and American Film
        Festival became popular not only among Polish audience but also abroad.

        Multiple restaurants, cafés, pubs and music clubs situated in the Four
        Denominations District (for example in the beautiful patio of the
        Synagogue, surrounded by old walls) make it one of the most magical
        meeting place in Wrocław.
