          Słodowa Island belongs to the Oder archipelago located to the north of

          Młyńska, Piasek, Daliowa and Tamka.

          The Island (Wyspa Słodowa) used to be built-up but during World War II
          most of the buildings were destroyed, only a six-storey tenement house
          survived.

          The picnic season begins on the 21st of March when the Island is
          crowded with students of secondary and upper-secondary schools
          celebrating Truant Day (firs day of spring). All year long the Island
          is under the “reign” of students. During summer weekends there are
          many attractions on the Island: on Fridays and Saturdays open-air
          cinema, Saturday concerts, board games, sport activities, on Sundays
          dance classes or open-air library.

        <p>In the tourist season one can buy something to eat and drink.</p>
